a) Detect host IP address, and uses this to determine current subnet. Iterates through IP's on current subnit host is on (xxx.xxx.xxx.1 - xxx.xxx.xxx.255) and outputs IP Address, Host Name and MAC address for each PC / device. Results are written to /output/ip.csv
b) Allows user to input any IP address. Outputs IP Address, Host Name and MAC address for given IP address. Results are written to /output/ip.csv
******************************
Requirements:
Python 2.7
******************************
Limitations:
HostMAC is meant to be run from a Windows client, as the program parses text returned from ARP -A commands in a Windows command prompt (cmd.exe). In other words, do not run it from a Linux or OSX box.
IPv4 compatible only.
